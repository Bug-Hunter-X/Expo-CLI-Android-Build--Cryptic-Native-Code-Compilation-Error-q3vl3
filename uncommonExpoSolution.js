The solution involves a multi-step diagnostic process. There is no single fix, as the root cause can vary.

1. **Inspect Build Logs:**  The most critical step is carefully examining the complete Android build logs. These logs, usually found in your terminal output after a failed build, will often reveal the true nature of the error, even if the Expo CLI doesn't give a clear message.

2. **Check Native Modules:** If your project uses native modules, make sure they are correctly configured and compatible with the current version of Expo. Review their respective documentation and ensure they are correctly integrated into your `android/app` directory.

3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, temporary files or cached data can cause build issues. Try cleaning the Android build directory using:
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean
```
Then try building again: `expo build:android`.

4. **Gradle Dependencies:** Investigate the `build.gradle` files within your `android` directory, specifically focusing on dependencies. Check for conflicts or outdated packages, which could be causing native code compilation problems. Consider updating all Gradle dependencies to their latest stable versions.

5. **Version Compatibility:** Double-check the compatibility of all project dependencies, including Expo modules and native libraries, with the current version of Expo you are using. Conflicts between versions are frequent causes of these vague build errors.  The `package.json` and `package-lock.json` may help identify version mismatches.

6. **Simplify and Isolate:** If the problem persists, systematically remove parts of your app until you identify which part is causing the error. This isolation method aids in discovering the specific piece of code causing the issue.
