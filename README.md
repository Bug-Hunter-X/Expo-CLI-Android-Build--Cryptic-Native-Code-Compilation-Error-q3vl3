# Expo CLI Android Build: Cryptic Native Code Compilation Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered during Android APK builds using the Expo CLI. The error is characterized by vague or cryptic messages, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause.  This often involves issues in the `android/app` directory but lacks specific error indicators from the Expo CLI itself.  The solution focuses on strategies to diagnose and address such obscure issues.

## Reproduction

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file contains a representative setup that might trigger such an error.  While a precise reproduction is difficult due to the nature of the bug, the file sets a foundation to illustrate the scenario.

## Solution

The `uncommonExpoSolution.js` file showcases methods to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. These include techniques like:

- **Inspecting the Android build logs:**  Detailed logging often reveals underlying problems.
- **Checking for native module issues:**  Incorrectly configured or incompatible native modules are common culprits.
- **Cleaning the Android build directory:** A fresh build can sometimes fix transient issues.
- **Gradle dependencies:** Examining Gradle dependencies and resolving any conflicts.
- **Version compatibility:** Ensuring all dependencies are compatible with Expo's version.

This repository intends to serve as a starting point for resolving similar cryptic errors during the Android build process within Expo.
